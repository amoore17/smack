## Description
A VI like text editor I am making in my spare time with ncurses. Right now,
there is very limited support. Visual mode has been implemented and insert
mode has very limited functionality. Do not use this text editor for any
serious work since it is currently under development.
## Installation Instructions
You will need to install ncurses on your operating system. You then just
need to run CMake. Sample command: `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`
### Ubuntu
sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
